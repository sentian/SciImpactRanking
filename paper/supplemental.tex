\section{The robustness of rp.rp5}
\label{sec:robustness_rprp}
The evaluation metric to formulate rp.rp5$_{i\tau}$ is an aggregation of the performances of all the publications that the author publish by age $\tau$. And to be more specific, we use rp.c$_{j5}$ to evaluate publication $j$, and the evaluation metric is given as the sum of all papers published by $\tau$, i.e. m.rp5$_{i\tau} = \sum_{j=1}^{N_\tau^{(i)}} \text{rp.c}_{j5}$ (the notation m.rp5 is to distinguish from other metrics we are going to study below). rp.c$_{j5}$ only utilizes the citation history of a publication in the first $5$ years. This may not seems to be adequate to represent the quality of a paper. However, as we show in figure \ref{fig:scatter_pubrp_bio1980}, rp,c is highly stable over ages, i.e. rp.c$_{j5}$ is likely to be close to rp.c$_{j10}$ for majority of the papers. 

We can consider other ways of summarizing the performance of a paper, and we show that not only such metrics have high correlations with m.rp5, but the rank percentile indicators based on these metrics are not statistically significantly different from rp.rp5. Consider the entire history that we have for publication $j$: rp.c$_{j1}$, rp.c$_{j2}$, $\cdots$, rp.c$_{j T_j}$. Besides evaluating the publication at certain age, we can use the summary statistic to take advantage of the entire history. For example, we can take the best performance throughout its career, i.e. $\displaystyle \max_{t=1,\cdots,T_j} \text{rp.c}_{jt}$, and aggregate them to formulate the evaluation metric, i.e. m.rpmax$_{i\tau} = \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{N_\tau^{(i)}} \max_{t=1,\cdots,T_j} \text{rp.c}_{jt}$. The correlation between m.rp5 and m.rpmax at each fixed age $\tau=1,\cdots,30$ is displayed in figure \ref{fig:robustness_test_cor}, and we can see that these two metrics are highly correlated. Meanwhile, other choices of the evaluation metrics also have high correlations with m.rp5 according to the figure. Furthermore, we construct rp.rpmax based on m.rpmax and study its difference with rp.rp5. We perform a paired t-test on the two samples rp.rpmax and rp.rp5 at each fixed age $\tau=1,\cdots,30$. The p-values that we get are all extremely close to $1$, which indicates that the difference between rp.rpmax and rp.rp5 is not significant. Similar results are obtained for other types: rp.rpmean, rp.rpmedian and rp.rp10.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rp_matrix}
\bordermatrix{
    & \text{age 1}     & \text{age 2}     & \cdots & \text{age $K$}     \cr
    \text{paper 1}     & \text{rp}_{11}^{(c)}     & \text{rp}_{12}^{(c)}     & \ldots & \text{rp}_{1 K}^{(c)}      \cr
    \text{paper 2}     & \text{rp}_{21}^{(c)}     & \text{rp}_{22}^{(c)}    & \ldots & \text{rp}_{2 K}^{(c)}     \cr
    \quad \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
    \text{paper $N$}     & \text{rp}_{N 1}^{(c)}     & \text{rp}_{N 2}^{(c)}     & \ldots  & \text{rp}_{N K}^{(c)}    \cr
}
\end{equation}

We take the maximum performance for each of the $N$ papers, and sum them:
\begin{equation}
    \omega_{i \tau} = \sum_{j=1,\cdots,N} \max_{k=1,\cdots, K} \text{rp}_{j k} ^{(c)}.
\end{equation}

\section{Stationarity test}
\label{sec:stationarity_test}
Two commonly used statistical tests for stationarity are the Dicky-Fuller test\supercite{dickey1979distribution} and KPSS test\supercite{kwiatkowski1992testing}. Two tests formulate the hypothesis testing problem differently. Dicky-Fuller test assumes a unit root is present in the series. A unit root means the series is $I(1)$, i.e. integrated order $1$ and the first differenced series is stationary. The more negative the test statistic is, the stronger the rejection of the null. On the other hand, KPSS test assumes the null as the series being stationary, i.e. $I(0)$. KPSS test is slightly more general since it allows testing a series being non-stationary but doesn't present a unit root. The more positive the test statistic is, the stronger the rejection of the null. Both tests include the drift in the test equations but exclude the trend, since we do not observe significant trends in the series. 

We apply these tests on each individual rp series. The test statistics are shown in figure \ref{fig:stationarity_test}. The dashed lines indicate the critical values at $5 \%$ level. KPSS test indicates that rp$^{(c)}$ and rp.rp5$^{(c)}$ are non-stationary, and we don't have enough evidence to reject them being $I(1)$ according to the Dicky-Fuller test. Meanwhile, the differenced series are stationary based on both tests.

The authors in our dataset remain active by year $2016$ and their publications in the early stage of career is usually less recognizable and attracts less citations, than those published more recently. Meanwhile, publications in biology generally have more citations per paper, which corresponds to the fact that biology is a highly productive field and it attracts a large number of citations.}

\clearpage
Three effects may lead to the non-stationarity of rank percentile for scholars are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Seniority effect of scholars: senior scholars can attract more citations than junior scholars. In figure \ref{fig:seniority}, we see that senior authors (e.g. those starting their careers in 1980s) do not have an advantage over junior authors (e.g. those starting their careers in 2000s). 
  \item Time effect: papers published more recently attract more citations than papers published $20$ years ago. This maybe due to the fact that the entire scientific community is growing, and we have much more scholars now than $20$ years ago, which makes the paper visible to a larger audience and potentially attracts more citations. Meanwhile, as Internet and especially social media becomes vital, papers now have much better visibility than those $20$ years ago. Figure \ref{fig:environment} shows that for the scholars starting their careers in $1980$, more recent papers attract more citations than old papers. Since we've already filtered out the seniority effect of the scholars, this is result from external effects. 
  \item Number of publications: scholars now tend to produce more publications than scholars say $20$ years ago. Evidence is shown in figure \ref{fig:npub}. 
\end{itemize}
We now fix the bias from the time effect and number of publications, in order to get stationary rank percentile indicators for scholars. Let's say we have a scholar $i$ who starts his/her career in physical year $Y_i$. For a paper $j$ that the scholar publishes in physical year $Y_j$, we calculate its rank percentile rp.c$_{j5}$ where the benchmark contains all the papers that are published in year $Y_j$. By restricting the benchmark in such way, we potentially remove the time effect. We repeat the process for all the papers of scholar $i$ that are published by age $t$ and obtain the metric $\sum_{j=1}^{N_t^{(i)}} \text{rp.c}_{j5}$. Furthermore, we calculate a rank percentile indicator rp.p$_{it}$ based on the number of publications by age $t$, and the benchmark is all the scholars who start their careers in physical year $Y_i$. Finally, we have the evaluation metric m$_{it} = \text{rp.p}_{it} \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{N_t^{(i)}} \text{rp.c}_{j5}$. The rank percentile indicator, denoted as rp.rp5, can be then computed based on m$_{it}$ and the benchmark is all or biology. 

Figure \ref{fig:compare_autrp} shows various types of scholar rank percentile indicators. Both rp.c and rp.h, that are based on total citations and h-index, show advantages for junior scholars due to the reasons explained above. However, rp.rp5 seems to be stationary.
