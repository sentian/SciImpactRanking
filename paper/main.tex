\begin{abstract}
Comparing the impact of a scholar to her senior colleagues or other young scholars in a different field, is often considered in the recruitment or tenureship decisions. Bibliometric indicators such as the number of citations or h-index can not be used directly, since they are highly influenced by the subject area, seniority of the author, etc. Here, we discuss a simple framework to construct rank percentile indicators based on the bibliometric indicators, allowing us to assess the relative performance of a publication or a scholar. Furthermore, we show that the rank percentile indicators have high predictive powers, and can be modeled using a simple linear regression model. While more advanced models offer slightly superior performance, the simplicity and interpretability of the simple model impose significant advantages over the complexity added.
