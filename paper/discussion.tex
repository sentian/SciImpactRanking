\section*{Discussion}

Rank percentile indicators compare the performance of a publication or a scholar relative to cohorts in the benchmark. They have the advantage of being interpretable and flexible in the choice of benchmark and evaluation metrics. We illustrate that the publication percentile is highly stable, while the scholar percentile exhibits short-term stability and can be predicted utilizing a simple linear regression model. In practice, the highly predictable rank percentiles can be utilized in combination with other metrics to picture the trajectory of a scholar or a publication and assist in academic decision making.
