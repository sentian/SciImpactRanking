### On the Usage of Rank Percentile in Evaluating and Predicting Scientific Impacts

This project studies utilizing rank percentile to evaluate publication or scholar impact. The percentile indicator is demonstrated to be highly predictive, and hence it can be utilized in combination with other metrics to picture the trajectory of a scholar or a publication and assist in academic decision making. For more details, see our paper [Tian, S. and Ipeirotis, P. (2021): "On the Usage of Rank Percentile in Evaluating and Predicting Scientific Impacts"](https://github.com/sentian/SciImpactRanking/blob/master/paper/ms.pdf).
